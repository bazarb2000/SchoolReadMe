# NOTABLE SCHOOL PROJECTS 
Thank you for taking the time to explore my academic projects! This repository holds a collection of projects and assignments that I completed during my academic studies. 
Unfortunately, I cannot share the code that I wrote since they are technically property of the University of Pennsylvania, but I can explain what projects I have done.\

# JAVA: COVID DATA TRACKER
I was tasked with developing a Java program that processes and analyzes real-world data related to Philadelphia's properties, population, and COVID-19 cases. The program accepts runtime arguments specifying data file names and provides a menu-driven interface for users to choose various actions, including calculating total populations, vaccination rates, property values, and implementing a custom feature. It must handle potential data errors, like missing or malformed entries, and display results based on the selected action, facilitating data-driven insights for users.

# Java: Battleship 
This project presents my Java programming skills through the implementation of the classic game Battleship. It highlights my object-oriented design approach and gameplay implementation.

# Java: Movie Trivia 
The Movie Trivia project demonstrates my ability to work with Java to create an interactive trivia game. It showcases my knowledge of data handling, user input, and game logic.

# Java: Simple 21 
Simple 21 is a Java project that showcases my understanding of basic algorithms and logic. It implements a simplified version of the card game "21" and demonstrates my ability to handle user input and perform game calculations.

# Python:Ice Cream 
The Ice Cream project demonstrates my Python programming skills by creating a system to manage an ice cream shop. It showcases my ability to work with data structures, file handling, and user interaction.
